Changes needed 

Create input validation and send an error message if there is an incorrect input

Make the final <print> section into one formal table

improve the "#notes" if at all needed

Make sure all logic is valid

Make it to where the numbers output at the end only go to 2 decimal points ex: 1230.45 instead of 1230.44600007
